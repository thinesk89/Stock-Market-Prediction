# Stock-Market-Prediction

Using Deep Learning techniques with Python Programming to predict the final stock price of Apple (APPL). Based on historical data, the stock price of APPL was predicted using Deep Learning. The Close Price, Open Price, Volume, High and Low Price of APPL stock was analyzed using Python programming on Google Colab for Exploratory Data Analysis. 



Using matplotlib to plot graphs of the stock price, and splitting the dataset into testing and training dataset, LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) is used as the Deep learning algorithm for prediction.
